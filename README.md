# Gameplay
The player is controlled using the WASD keys while the mouse is used to aim while right click is used to shoot. The player can also dash in a direction by pressing spacebar. Finally, the game can be paused by hitting ESC. 

Each round, a number of enemies will spawn that will damage the player if they get too close. The player can kill the enemies by shooting them and once killing all of them, the round completes. At the end of each round, the player is given a random of choice of three powerup cards of varying rarity. The player continues through the rounds until the enemies eventually overwhelm them.
